## 💁 How to contribute?

I must say that one part of this website is open-source which you can contribute and bring value.
It is very easy, It is like writing a blog.
If you see this [page](https://www.anilearn.dev/docs/intro), We need to write docs and somehow make the concepts easy for others to learn them.

Come and write your own lesson.

### How to write the docs?

The steps that you need to follow:

1. Go to the blog folder `./blog`
2. Choose a topic that you want to make a blog about
   > **Warning** <br />
   > You are not allowed to add new folders in `./blog`.
3. Make a file (`*.mdx`)

### I don't know about `mdx`!

It is okay, you can take a look on other files for understanding how MDX works.

You can see the styles [here]() to make your blog beautiful.

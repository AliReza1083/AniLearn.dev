## üíÅ How to contribute?

I must say that one part of this website is open-source, which means you can contribute and bring value. It's very easy; it's like writing a blog. If you visit this [page](https://www.anilearn.dev/docs), you'll see that we need to write docs and make the concepts easy for others to learn.

Come and write your own lesson.

It's okay, you can take a look at other files to understand how MDX works.

# 4 ways of centering a div

If you struggle with centering a div, you're not alone. This blog is here to provide you with some helpful tips.

There are 4 ways which we center a div

## 1. Flex-Box

by using flex-box properties, you can easily center a div with 3 lines of code.

```css:style.css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh; /* Giving it a hight to center them completely */
}
```

## 2. Grid-Box

You can center a div with 2 and 3 lines of code by using Grid-Box properties.

3 lines of code:

```css:style.css
.container {
    display: grid;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh; /* Giving it a hight to center them completely */
}
```

2 lines of code:

```css:style.css
.container {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    height: 100vh; /* Giving it a hight to center them completely */
}
```

## 3. position - absolute

You can center a div by following code:

```css:style.css
.item {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

<Warning>
  Avoid using `position: absolute` to position an element, as it can be
  inefficient and cause significant responsiveness issues.
</Warning>

## 4. margin

```css:style.css
.item {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: auto;
}
```

<Success>
  For **flex-box** and **grid-box**, we target the container, which affects the
  items inside it. However, for **absolute** and **margin**, we target only one
  item.
</Success>

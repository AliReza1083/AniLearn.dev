# 5 ways to find projects in Open Source

One of the challenges faced by a beginner is to find an Open Source project to contribute. The best way to kick start your contribution is by contributing to friends and community projects.

In the Blog, we will look at some built-in GitHub functionality to find great projects. We will also look at tools developed by the **EddieHub** and **OSWC** communities.

1. Good First Issue Finder by [EddieHub Community](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity)
   It finds good first issues from all over GitHub and gives you a list of them. We can further filter down the Issues by clicking the labels.

- GitHub's advanced search. GitHub advanced search provides tons of filters to find repos and issues according to our preferences. We can filter by language, extension, Issue labels, no. of stars/forks, etc.

- GitHub Topics <br />
  It's a very cool feature on GitHub. With the help of this, we can find a particular project with a topic. The topic can be languages, events, tech, etc.

- Good First Issue label `good first issue` is the best way to start your Open Source journey. We can find all of those on GitHub by doing a label search.

  > Link - [github.com/issues....](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

- OSWC <br />
  It contains lists of projects which are beginners friendly. We can filter out projects by languages and non-code contributions.

# Different way of writing function()

If you want to declare items to be used in multiple places, repeating the same code will not make your program scalable.
`function()` can help make the process easier.

> You can find more information about the `function()` [here](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-function/)

## There are several approaches we can take to utilizing the `function()` function.

### 1. Function Declaration

Function declaration is a way of defining a function in JavaScript using the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and the function body enclosed in curly braces. Once declared, the function can be called and executed at any point in the code.

```js:app.js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 2. Function Expression

In JavaScript, a function expression is a way to define a function as a value and assign it to a variable. This allows the function to be used as a parameter in another function, or to be called later in the code.

```js:app.js
const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 3. Arrow Function

Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for creating functions in JavaScript. They are more concise and can make code easier to read.

```js:app.js
const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 4. Short callbacks

Arrow short callbacks are a concise way of writing arrow functions that take only one argument and have a single expression as the function body.

```js:app.js
const add = (a, b) =>  a + b;
```
It is particularly useful for simple and short functions, and it is not necessary to use the 'return' keyword to return a value when using this syntax.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Since the new GitHub Issue forms, we only suggest you include the most information possible. But you can also Perform a [cursory](https://github.com/AliReza1083/AniLearn.dev/issues) search to see if the report/request has already been raised. If it has, adds a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.

## Suggesting Enhancements

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
